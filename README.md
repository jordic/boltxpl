#### BoltXplr

Bolt explorer tries to be a boltdb browser. 

**Status**

Currently there is a funciontal prototype, you can browse buckets, and inspect keys, 
but still there can be a lot of bugs, and a lot of caveats.



#### Motivation

I had started using boltdb in some of my projects, and when developing, sometimes, 
I just want to check my db and browse it, in a easy way. 


#### Installation

go get github.com/jordic/boltxpl/...

and you will end up with a xpl, command in your go bin path.


#### Contribution

I will be super happy, if someone else finds this project util, and start using it.
Also It will be amazing, if anybody wants to contribute to the project. 

Feel free to fork, and send a PR.
